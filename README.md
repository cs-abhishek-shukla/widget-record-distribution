# Overview

The Record Distribution widget provides the ability to visualise records or items based on a specified grouping. For example, viewing the distribution of assets by purdue levels, or the distribution of alerts by type, severity, etc.

**Note**: Preview releases are a beta release. This means that release is intended to get feedback and might not be best suited for production level deployments. The functionality might change in backward-incompatible ways or have limited support. A beta release is not subject to any SLA, Quality Assurance or deprecation policy. Feature availability and support for preview releases will continue to improve as the solution/feature matures.
